                <h3>Advancing Deep Learning Techniques for Multi-Modal Data Fusion and Medical Image Segmentation</h3>
                <p>Our research spans multiple domains, applying advanced deep learning techniques to solve complex challenges. One of our key focuses is multi-modal data fusion, where we developed Quantum Inverse Contextual Vision Transformers (Q-ICVT) to integrate sparse 3D data with dense visual features. This method enhances tasks such as object detection and feature extraction by leveraging reversible vision transformers and quantum computing principles.

In the field of digital dentistry, we explored tooth segmentation from intraoral scans. Our work identified a significant performance drop in existing deep learning models when applied to partial jaw scans, despite their high accuracy on full jaw models. We conducted extensive studies to highlight this issue and proposed the development of more robust segmentation techniques.

These research efforts reflect our broader commitment to advancing deep learning methods with a focus on robustness and practical application across diverse domains.

                <h3>Use of Residential History in Spatial Epidemiology</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on utilizing residential history data to improve spatial epidemiological models. The aim is to understand how residential movement patterns influence health outcomes, particularly for diseases like cancer. We developed a robust framework to incorporate these data into health geographic analysis.</p>

                <h3>NLP - Topic Modelling</h3>
                <p>This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze latent topics from large-scale textual data. Topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were applied to a variety of text sources to uncover hidden patterns and trends across different domains.</p>
